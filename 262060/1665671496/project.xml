A young man who&apos;s name was Alphonse, got his life ruined cause of Ancestor&apos;s madness.
He lost everything of his past life, which now belong to the past now he&apos;s bound to a dead body,
which despite of being robust is protean and can change as he wish, and he will need to learn how to use it,
to survive in a world which no longer want him...
