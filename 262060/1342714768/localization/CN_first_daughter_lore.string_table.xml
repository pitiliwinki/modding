But that wasn't the weirdest thing about her equipment. Her bow... It was broken in half. It isn't strange that she can't perform correctly as an archer. She should leave this place before being killed by her own recklessness.]]></entry>

		<entry id="action_verbose_body_guild_first_daughter"><![CDATA[This archer is inconsistent, to say the least. From the beginning, she had an odd behavior when fighting. Insecure about who or when to strike, and this resulted in her becoming an inconsistent companion. I don't know how other archers love fighting alongside her or how they can trust her as the vanguard, but as long all the group cooperates she just might have a chance.]]></entry>

		<entry id="action_verbose_body_camping_trainer_first_daughter"><![CDATA[After the battle, she took off her armor revealing all her wounds. There weren't any cuts since they all were healed while in battle. Neither she nor I could really say much, as we both knew the other's struggles too well to even try to complain... So I just bandaged her remaining injuries in silence, knowing she trusted us more than she trusts herself.]]></entry>
