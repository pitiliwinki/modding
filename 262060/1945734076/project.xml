[h1][b]Introduction[/b][/h1]
[h1]------------------------------------------[/h1]
The Rogue Knight is a class mod based on Dota 2&apos;s Sven. This mod includes a hero with custom sprites, four palettes, a unique skillset based on his Dota 2 abilities, ten trinkets, and over 500 custom dialogue lines. He is a frontline melee combatant filling a similar role to the Leper, though with more utility and ability to support his teammates.
