    <entry id="action_verbose_body_guild_phantom"><![CDATA[The Phantom is a specialist in many weapons arts, having travelled to the west of Europe and all the way across to the east he mixes the different techniques into his own style. He may use stealth to set up an attack or to vanish right in front of his foes, confusing them. Besides his prowess in the art of combat, he has a good eye to spot weaknesses in a team and is also capable of pulling out some divine favors so long as his allies are willing to cooperate for the price.]]></entry>

Allies that share his views with him may get the Phantom more inclined to support them and if the group doesn't need any special care, then the Phantom may reserve some time to hone his own skills or equipment.]]></entry>
