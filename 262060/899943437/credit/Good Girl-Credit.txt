[h1]Good Girl - Class Mod[/h1]
====================================

[i]“Ru Ru Ruuuuuu!”[/i]

Bone breaking jaw lined with dagger like teeth; a good combination, as long as you are not the one holding the meat.

[b]Role:[/b]
She is a real bit-ch to play with. A fragile melee glass cannon. Have pretty hurtful attacks, but some are hard to control than other (she is a wild one, afterall). Will almost always end up at the front line, she has pretty low HP, so be sure to pack a support skill or a back line support character to help her out.

[b]Playing Tips:[/b]
[spoiler]
Most of its attack move it foward, so it work well with team that can't move well.

She has a wide range of damage value.  Bit of hit or miss.

Use her to hunt beasts.
