1.Description
-----------------

Hidden in a box of supplies ordered from far away lands, this one was hiding. You&apos;re not entirely sure who&apos;s in control. The Ghost or the Girl ?

The Hollow is a backrow healer, with a twisted twist.

-----------------
2.Known Issues
-----------------

//FMOD debug warning
&gt; Ignore, it&apos;s not a bug. Probably could code her SFX better but it just means the game won&apos;t load something that&apos;s already loaded.

//Town Event / Trinkets
&gt; No bonus Hollow recruits event, i don&apos;t want to bloat the player&apos;s events. Idle resolve bonus only.
&gt; CC Trinkets here : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128408705

//Boobs
Adress your complaints to Mr Trash Mc Can, idgaf@reeeweebs.com
&gt; no nipples here http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1189535304
