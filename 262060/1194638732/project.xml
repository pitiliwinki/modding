	New class mod: Templar Arbalest.

Attracted by strange rumours, the Temple sent one of its followers to investigate the situation.

Templar arbalest destroys enemies at a distance thanks to his crossbow. If necessary, he can take close combat, relying on his silver-plated armor.

Skills:
Deadly shot - powerful shot with a silver bolt. Additional damage to undead and a high chance of critical strike.
Bodkin bolt - armour-piercing shot.
Quicksilver - a special mixture of the Temple. For the undead, with love.
Radiance - attracting the attention of the enemy. However, the hero is ready for this (activating riposte + prot buff).
Holy light - crystal vessel with a glowing liquid. There is engraving: &quot;Phial of Galadriel&quot;.
Close combat - hit in the stomach and retreat back. How noble!
Blinding shot - a dazzling volley into the sky. Why the allies do not become blind - a big secret.

Trinkets:
Toxic silver: +20% bligh chance.
Persecutor ring: +3 SPD/-3 DODGE
Code of the Temple: +20% DMG/-15% stress damage/ -10% PROT
Templar goblet: +35 virtue/-15% stress/-10% DMG
Permission for eliminating: +25% DMG/+ 7 ACC/+ 5 CRT/ +15 stress damage/ -30 healing receive

Translation:
English as base.
Русский перевод добавлен.
======================
I do not know how to draw (just dirty copypaste magic), so suppose that crusader, arbalest and templar arbalest bought an armour from one blacksmith.

Balance, bug, awful translation - all reply welcome.
