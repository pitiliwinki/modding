	<ItemDescription>[i]&quot;Reared on tales of his family’s former glory, the Heir sought to reclaim it. Miscalculating the true extent of the nightmare that awaited and educated for a life of indolence, he is ill-equipped for adventure in both mind and body. Wracked with guilt and emboldened by wine, the Heir resolves to share the burden of this arduous quest.&quot;
