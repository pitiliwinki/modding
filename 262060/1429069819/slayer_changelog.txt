Slayer Changelist v1.02 Release

Bugfixes:
	- Fixed a number of smaller animation errors.
	- Fixed a couple stats that were improperly changed.
	- Fixed the debuff chance on Tag and Bag to properly scale with levels.
	- Fixed icon border colours.
	- Added new bloodsplatter on Biting Blade.

Balance:
	- Lowered Slayer base damage at all levels to be more in line with DD's base classes.
		- Slayer was dealing about the same amount of damage as a Shieldbreaker while having Man-at-Arms durability. With this change and the ones below the Slayer should be dealing roughly the same amount of damage as a Bounty Hunter per round.
	- Increased damage modifier on Run and Gun by 5% across all levels.
	- Increased damage modifier on Biting Blade to 0% (up from -15%) across all levels.
	- Adjusted the stress healing from Rip and Tear to 4/6/8
	- Adjusted the healing from Rip and Tear to 2/4/6
	- Tag and Bag now counts as a stalling skill.
	- Fourfold Harm Charm now prevents the Slayer from being guarded. Sorry lads, you gotta take your lumps.
	
Misc:
	- Added 10 new names for party compositions, with more to be added later.
	- Still working on the sound conflict with certain mods, haven't been able to replicate it on my testing saves.
	- Slayer now consistently shows up in the Stagecoach at the same rate as vanilla heros.




Slayer Changelist v1.01 Release


Bugfixes:
	- Fixed an animation desync in a couple skills
	- Slayer should spawn normally in the Stagecoach
	- Slayer should now correctly be getting bonuses from the Training Ring
	- Deployed a potential fix to the audio conflicts between certain mods.
	- Removed some superfluous animations and art files.
	- Fixed a bug that prevented BFG's full animation from playing.
	
Balance
	- Lowered the damage on Run and Gun by 5% at all levels. 
		- Realistically this is only a 1-2pt damage difference but it means that if you want to kill one thing it's better to use Biting Blade. Hopefully this will put a little more emphasis on the solution to all your monster-related problems being more than liberal application of shotguns.
	- Adjusted damage scaling for BFG
		- Now ranges from -20% to 0% at max level. Should feel better to use at lower levels and be easier to calculate damage later on.
	- Lowered damage on Reeling Reload to -70% at all levels
	- Changed Reeling Reload's targets to O O - - | - O O O
		- Should give the Slayer something to do when he's in the back row and almost-but-not-quite everything is dead.
