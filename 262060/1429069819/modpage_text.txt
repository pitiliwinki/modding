The Slayer is a brutal, doomed warrior hell-bent on the destruction of the horrors that surround the hamlet. Wielding a demon-bound shotgun and donning eldritch corrupted platemail, the Slayer uses the monster's powers against them in the unending crusade to release the manor from the grip of darkness.

The Slayer is most comfortable in the middle ranks where he can unleash hellfire from the mouth of his slavering shotgun, but is not afraid of getting up close and personal to use his impossible brute strength to literally tear the life out of his opponents. When the beast's thirst for violence reaches its peak, he can unleash a single glorious strike bound to annihilate whatever unfortunate soul crosses their path. But be wary; the eldritch horrors possessing the Slayer's equipment are fickle, and have been known to lash out in anger if called upon too often.


-- Please note this initial release may have some bugs, string errors, or odd looking animations. The class is stable, but we'll be continuing to update the mod and fixing bugs as they appear. Let us know in the comments if something seems odd, or your thoughts on the character. Be aware there may be languages that lack a proper Localization for the class; if you're playing in one of these languages and get odd blue text in place of names or skills, let us know and we'll fix it.

Slayer Changelist v1.01 Release


Bugfixes:
	- Fixed an animation desync in a couple skills
	- Slayer should spawn normally in the Stagecoach
	- Slayer should now correctly be getting bonuses from the Training Ring
	- Deployed a potential fix to the audio conflicts between certain mods.
	
Balance
	- Lowered the damage on Run and Gun by 5% at all levels. 
		- Realistically this is only a 1-2pt damage difference but it means that if you want to kill one thing it's better to use Biting Blade. Hopefully this will put a little more emphasis on the solution to all your monster-related problems being more than liberal application of shotguns.
	- Adjusted damage scaling for BFG
		- Now ranges from -20% to 0% at max level. Should feel better to use at lower levels and be easier to calculate damage later on.
	- Lowered damage on Reeling Reload to -70% at all levels
	- Changed Reeling Reload's targets to O O - - | - O O O
		- Should give the Slayer something to do when he's in the back row and almost-but-not-quite everything is dead.
