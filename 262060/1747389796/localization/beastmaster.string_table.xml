When the time is right, he can {colour_start|notable}Prowl{colour_end} away from the heat of frontline combat and prepare: either for a deadly ambush or to call upon the spirits in aid of his pack.

  	<entry id="action_verbose_body_camping_trainer_beastmaster"><![CDATA[As a master of wildlife, the Beastmaster uses his surroundings to ensure the group's survival. He adapts to the fallow regions surrounding the hamlet by utilizing endemic herbs and consulting local spirits. During long nights, he wanders off to commune with animals and track down potential threats, making him a perfect scout to ensure safe exploration through these corrupted lands.]]></entry>

	<entry id="action_verbose_body_guild_beastmaster"><![CDATA[This man embodies the duality of nature, serving as both wise shaman and deadly predator. Swift and cunning, the Beastmaster can hunt down his prey in wild close combat, inflicting bleeding wounds in his righteous rage. When the time is right, he can {colour_start|notable}Prowl{colour_end} away from the heat of frontline combat and prepare: either for a deadly ambush or to call upon the spirits in aid of his pack. In nature, nothing is wasted: fallen corpses can be consumed to gain great power, or be seeded to create a temporary ally.]]></entry>	
<entry id="action_verbose_body_camping_trainer_beastmaster"><![CDATA[As a master of wildlife, the Beastmaster uses his surroundings to ensure the group's survival. He adapts to the fallow regions surrounding the hamlet by utilizing endemic herbs and consulting local spirits. During long nights, he wanders off to commune with animals and track down potential threats, making him a perfect scout to ensure safe exploration through these corrupted lands.]]></entry>
	<entry id="action_verbose_body_blacksmith_beastmaster"><![CDATA[The Beastmaster eschews heavy armor, needing little more than life-affirming flesh and twin blades to defy corruption. Druidic knowledge and shamanic abilities provide finer protection than any steel. The ritual tattoos painted across his body are carved in exaltation of nature spirits, marking him as the embodiment of vengeance for all wildlife tainted by malicious evil.]]></entry>
