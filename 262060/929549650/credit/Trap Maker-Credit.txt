[h1]Trap Maker - Class Mod[/h1]
====================================

[i]“Curiosity, like a wiggling worm, makes for a good bait for the awaiting death. ”[/i]

Now the Trap Maker’s advocacy can be witness by his own eyes.  A Trap Maker utilizes the vast traps found around the dungeon for his own purpose.  And if that didn’t do the job, his blunderbuss would help finish the rest.


[b]Role:[/b]
Trap Maker is a back-line DPS character.  While not highest in damage, his attack often provide debuff to the enemy, to help setup for a following attack.  A bit of mix bag, with few different tricks. However, he does have lower HP and movement, so be careful to keep him alive. 


====================================

[b]Design Note:[/b]
Finally port this over from Nexus.  I think he was done over a year ago.
While don't think offer anything too special in term of mechanic and gameplay, I think he is still a decent function hero for additional backrow option.  

====================================

[b]Skills:[/b]

-Blunderbusster: basic attack
-Iron Maiden: stun and bleeder
-Blade Wheel: AoE with bleed
-Spikes Trap: attack with debuff
-Stone Fall: Aoe with shuffle
-Armor Breaker: attack that shave off defensive enemy
-Escape Door: move back and increase dodge.

====================================

[b]Playing Tips:[/b]
[spoiler]
Escape Door is a pretty good ability.  Consider putting TM up in front at start of fight to use it.

Helpful in dungeon where mob are weak against bleed, or with high defense.
