[h1]Pit Fighter - Class Mod[/h1]
====================================

[i]“Crack and knuckle, I Hurt Their Head.”[/i]

Mathematic, arithmetic, literacy; those are not the usual things that one associated Pit Fighter with. But one thing that a Pit Fighter knows quite well, and that’s skull cracking.

[b]Role:[/b]
If you enjoy pulverizing a helpless skeleton down to bits and pieces with your own raw hard fist, then unleash the Pit Fighter! Pit Fighters are skill in not only dishing out damages, but also grant adverse effects onto the face on the other side of their fist.  Pit Fighters are also master of taunting, able to curse an apple off the tree.

====================================

[b]Design Note:[/b]
Added:  Now with 100% more beard. (new skin).  Made him more than 2 years ago.  The goal is to intergated into the normal game well.  So hopfully he plays balance as a mod character.
