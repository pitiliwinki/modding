[h1]PICAROON V1.4[/h1]

*NEW! ChineseS Translation by 会喊666的咸鱼干

[list]
	The &quot;sole-survivor&quot; from an eldritch attack on a schooner off the coast near the Hamlet, the Picaroon is an agile gun-toting treasure-hunting pirate. She wields trusty pistols but in battle can also throw Toxic and Shredding Bombs. She can also disrupt enemy formations by firing a large, powerful Cannon. The Cannon can only be used sparingly and needs time to reload. She misses her former shipmates, will she find her redemption, or join her crew?

[h1]Some technical tid-bits[/h1]
[list]
	[*]Uses Musketeer (free DLC, not required for the mod) skeleton and animations for the character. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/araylie/myworkshopfiles/[b]Araylie[/url] re-scaled the skeleton bigger, but there is no custom animations, everything is based on vanilla stuff, edited from there.
	Even tough she uses vanilla skeletons and animations, there is ATLAS-tweaks (number edits in text files) used to change the mold somewhat, I&apos;ll try to put up short tutorial of it in the future.
	[*]All the art is uniquelly drawn for Pica, outside some skill fx, and obvious stuff like icon borders and such.
	[*]Sounds are mix of vanilla, and Dem22s edits.
	[*][b]Optimized pngs = smaller size, lighter mod[/b]. All of the character art pngs are optimized, size reduction is over 70% smaller than with traditional png, with basically zero quality loss.
	
Crop from un-edited screenshot, from 4k gameplay, one of the pngs characters is optimized (70+% smaller file size), other isn&apos;t:

[list]		
	Non optimized pngs available at Nexus as option if you wish to use them instead, optional file, link above.
	If you do personal edits to the pngs, I suggest grabbing the non optimized ones from there, and editing those.
