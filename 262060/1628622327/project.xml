[h1] === Summary === [/h1]

First ever mod, yaaay. The Heir is a healer/damage dealer based in the backline. She uses occult magic and channels it through her book.

[i] &quot;Born too late to enjoy the family&apos;s once plentiful luxury, The Heir was instead raised within a cult. Growing up learning the same research that drove her Ancestor mad, The Heir instead has drawn power from the ancient incantations, deadly to foes and able to provide uncoventional healing to her teammates.&quot; [/i]
