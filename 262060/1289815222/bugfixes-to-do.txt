Some thoughts on trinket design:

	My personal philosophy on trinkets differs from Red Hook's in a couple ways, chief among them regarding trinket strength as rarity increases. While incrementing power on trinkets as they get more difficult to find is a valid way of design, my personal method when it comes to trinkets is to instead increment complexity.
		- Common class trinkets are baseline useful to have. They'll accentuate a class's strengths, or shore up weaknesses while having mauluses that minimally impact the way the class wants to play.
		
		- Uncommon trinkets are core items that help define a class's role. Lustrous Incense for the Omen Seeker, and Haunted Cubes for the Cataphract, are both examples of specialized core trinkets that are always useful regardless of what point you're at in the game.
		
		- Rare and Very Rare trinkets should do one of two things; emphasize class strengths, or completely change the way you play the character. Red Hood Idol makes you want to put a fragile backliner into the front rank, Cataphract's Skull of Knowledge emphasizes his healing spells at the expense of damage. Ebbing Deck turns the Omen Seeker into an increasingly effective dodge tank the lower her health gets, Scorched Saddle emphasizes the Cataphract's flexibility as a frontline tank or backline damage dealer.
		
		- Crimson Court Trinkets are where one can really experiment with potentially unusual effects. The Cataphract's War Hero set encourages you to take the potential Virtue/Afflicted downsides and turn them into positives, allowing adaptable players to hotswap the Cataphract based on which affliction or virtue he rolls. The Omen Seeker's Unfortunate set is expressly designed NOT to be used together; one part turns her into a powerful stunner, the other into a self-sufficient boss killer/minor stress healer, but both completely remove her ability to deal damage with the skills they're meant to enhance. It's an unusual gimmick, but I've enjoyed making them. I'm interested in seeing how players adapt to the design.
		
		- Trinket mauluses and downsides can often look or feel bad, but the biggest downside is often opportunity cost. With so many Must-Bring trinkets like the Ancestor's Map, Junia's Head, Focus Ring, or Sun Rings, the strength of a trinket isn't in what it brings, but what you DON'T bring. This is called Opportunity Cost, and is a major balancing factor when comparing trinkets. Of course, there are people who say to hell with that and mod their game so they can bring three or more trinkets, but these people are subhuman and we will not be paying an attention to them.
		
	Going forward these will largely be the guiding tenants on how I plan to balance upcoming class trinkets. I may revisit this at some point to further refine my process, though. Looking forward to looking back!
