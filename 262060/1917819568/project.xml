	<ItemDescription>[i]&quot;The narrow-minded fools refuse to accept that the Flame is but half the story...&quot;[/i]

Denounced by the Church for &quot;straying from the Light&quot;, these former Vestals now seek out those texts declared forbidden and apocryphal in their search for the Truth. Many question their morality, but none doubt their tenacity...

[h1]---- Overview ---------------------------------------------------------------[/h1]
[img]https://i.imgur.com/tuNxztF.gif[/img]

The Apostate acts as a formidable group leader who empowers allies as their wounds mount. Despite renouncing the healing practices of the Vestal, she still has the uncanny ability to keep others from succumbing to death, albeit through very different techniques. When provoked, she is capable of unleashing power that devastates any who stand in her way.

[h1]---- FAQ --------------------------------------------------------------------[/h1]
[quote][i]&quot;What district does the Apostate use?&quot;[/i][/quote]
The Athenaeum.
[quote][i]&quot;Any party class restrictions?&quot;[/i][/quote]
None! She can team up with any class. Try grouping her with a Vestal to discover unique dialogue lines.
[quote][i]&quot;Can I use multiple Apostates in a party?&quot;[/i][/quote]
Yes!
[quote][i]&quot;What is her crit effect?&quot;[/i][/quote]
She buffs the party with &quot;-Crits Received Chance&quot; when she crits.
[quote][i]&quot;Custom afflictions/virtues?&quot;[/i][/quote]
The goal was for Apostate to feel like a new vanilla class. She therefore uses the normal pool of afflictions &amp; virtues.
[quote][i]&quot;Does she have a special low health or death effect?&quot;[/i][/quote]
No, for the same reason.
[quote][i]&quot;What is her default name?&quot;[/i][/quote]
Dolores.
[quote][i]&quot;Will the Apostate conflict with any other mods?&quot;[/i][/quote]
No.
[quote][i]&quot;Anything I need to know?&quot;[/i][/quote]
Try to avoid summoning the &apos;Walking Corpse&apos; during bossfights, as summons in this game can sometimes interfere with boss mechanics or quest credit!
[quote][i]&quot;What languages are supported?&quot;[/i][/quote]
English, French, Russian, Spanish, Simplified Chinese &amp; Brazilian Portuguese. If you&apos;d like to bring the Apostate to new languages contact me on Steam or on Discord! ([b]TheHolyChicken#3422[/b])
