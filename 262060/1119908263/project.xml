1.Description
-----------------

The Offering was supposed to be sacrificed to some higher entity, who chose instead, as a form of cruel joke, to steal her heart and give her another&apos;s.

She&apos;s a Tank hybrid meant to be played on the frontline.
This is the version 2.0 of my &quot;The Offering&quot; mod i uploaded a year ago on the Nexus. That means the Offering 1.0 is now officially unsupported and will no longer be updated.

-----------------
2.Known Issues
-----------------

//Offering 1.0
&gt; I no longer support this version, if you use it, make sure you completely clean it before installing 2.0 OR YOU WILL HAVE CONFLICTS.

//FMOD debug error
&gt; Ignore, just loading monster SFX and sometimes it&apos;s not needed 

//Guard tooltip
&gt; Disregard the tooltip saying it&apos;s 1 turn. Her guards are battle long and she can hold multiple at once, as intended. 

//Town Event / Trinkets
&gt; No bonus Offering recruits event, i don&apos;t want to bloat the player&apos;s events. Idle resolve bonus only.
&gt; CC Trinkets here : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?edit=true&amp;id=1128411084

//Boobs
I like boobs
&gt; no nipples here http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1189623020

4.Changelog - important changes only -
-----------------
#2.6

- Crit effect: -33% Stress (3 rds)
- CRT from  3/3.5/4/4.5/5% to 2/3/4/5/6%

- Can&apos;t herb +DMG Received%, now clears on battle end too.
- Mellow has infinite uses again, but is now tied to HP threshold. Prot buff duration down from battle to 3 turns. CRT from 2/2/2/3/3 to 4/5/6/7/8
- Liscentious : Move res from 70 to 20, duration from 4 to 3, no longer mark herself, move forward from 1 to 2, CRT from  3/3.5/4/4.5/5% to 4/5/6/7/8%
- Toned down RES to be in line with other frontliners.
- Rescaled Tachycardia self stun for new Stun RES values, increased stress heal by 2
