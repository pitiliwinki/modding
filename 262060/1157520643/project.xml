MY MODS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OFFICIAL DLCs, COMMUNITY PROJECTS OR IN ANY WAY TAILORED FOR THE LARGEST POSSIBLE AUDIENCE.
I chose to share what i create for my own playthroughs, if it doesn&apos;t suit you then it&apos;s simply not for you, just chill and move on.

1.Description
-----------------

The Hood is fresh off the wagon as a brothel girl, but it seems like a better idea to put her strange aptitudes to good use during expeditions instead. 
For some reason she just won&apos;t shut up about her granma.

I really like the Antiquarian in both design and utility but over the course of a playthrough it becomes kinda tedious to always do money runs with the same face.
The Hood is a fickle alternative to the Antiquarian, slightly less lucrative but slightly more support oriented, with her own unique twists.

-----------------
2.Known Issues - FAQ
-----------------

//Inventory management
&gt; The Hood&apos;s tokens stack up to 30, they are also consummables.
&gt; Contrary to the Antiquarian she can&apos;t find rare tokens.
&gt; She doesn&apos;t increase gold stacks size, instead she increases provisions (food) stack max size up to 36.
&gt; Increased provision stack size doesn&apos;t take effect until you&apos;re inside a dungeon, at which point you can drag your stacks together.

//No shared camping skills ?
&gt; No, it will be obvious why

Please thank him too ! Otherwise the Hood would have lame engrish dialogues.
