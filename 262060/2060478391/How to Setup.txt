	Or any File Renaming Software/Code Editor

-----------------------------------------------------------------
0 - Preparation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1) Choose an ID for your class
This is what your class is named on a code level.

Different mods with same class IDs conflict
therefore avoid general terms like "vampire" "varrior" or use a Prefix

2)Create a work folder
Name the Folder exactly as your class ID, put all the template contents into said folder 
*Save the folder directory somewhere you will need it iin later steps

-----------------------------------------------------------------
I - Renaming the Files 
-----------------------------------------------------------------


1)Open Rename Master (or you renaming programm) 
	Choose your Work Folder 
	Use Subfolder Scan to mark all files
	Use function "[6]Find and Replace"
	Replace any instance of the word "MyTemplate" with your class ID
	
	*Rename master will not rename the folder inside "heroes". 
	Open the "heroes" Folder and rename "MyTemplate" to your class ID 
	Inside the Hero Folder rename the sprite Folder "MyTemplate_A" to "YourCLassId_A"

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Step II - Renaming the Code
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The following steps describe renaming with notepad++ the method might differ depending on your text editing software

1) Open Notepad++ 
Make sure to close all recently opened Files, save your current workspace

2) Setup Workspace
Choose "File" --> "Open Folder as Workspace"--> Select your recently created and renamed Workfolder
This step will open all files inside your Template folder wich is important for Step 3) & 4) 

Optional: Save this workspace to navigate easier through files when developing

3) Replace all Class ID Instances
	Press CRTL+F to open the Search menue
	Choose the Tab "Find in Files"
	Toggle on: "In all Subfolders", "Match Case"
	! Make sure that the Folder Directoy is your Work Folder
	Press "Replace in Files" to replace "MyTemplate" with your class ID 

4) Replace All Skill iDs 
	The Skills have Placeholder Id's "MySkill_1" - "MySkill_7" 
	You can replace them in the same way you replaced your Class ID 

	Determine the Ids of your skills (this is the internal name not the diplay name) 
	Makes sure they are unique maybe use a prefix to avoid conflicts with other mods
	

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Step III - Upload Test Object to Steam 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Open your Darkest Dungeon Diretory

Its usually located at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DarkestDungeon\_windows

	Open the steam_workshop_uploader.exe and read the information
	You can then close the application 

	Open your Workfolder in a separate window
	Open the project.xml with Notepad++
	Change <ModDataPath></ModDataPath> to the directory of your work folder
	Delete this line	<PublishedFileId></PublishedFileId>
	Save and exit 
	
	Now drag the project.xml with your mouse on the steam_workshop_uploader.exe
	in the other window. It will now open the uploader.
	
	By Uploading a new Steam workshop object is generated. 
	By default its visibility is set on private.
	You can acces it by Profile--> My workshop 
	Subscribe to it to donwnload your mod to your game 
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Step IV - Updating
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To update your mod edit the files inside your workfolder and drag and drop the project 
in the uploader. 
!!! You might need to resub to your own mod and wait for steam to download to properly update 


Advanced:
Altenrativly you can open your mod directory
Usually located at:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\

locate your mod id from the URl displayed on the steam object 
and open the folder with the corresponding ID 
This is the folder where your mod copy for the game itself is stored 
To upate it locally set the uplaod mode to "Don't submit" 
this will just update your local files for your testing
