-----------------
1.Description
-----------------

Rejected some time ago as a defect Warrens experiment, the Fawn somehow found her way in your estate. She&apos;s completely oblivious to what happens around her, but at least she&apos;s not hostile.

She&apos;s a pure glass canon, centered around shuffling and momentum building for increasingly powerful attacks, at the cost of an incredibly fragile and deteriorating constitution.

-----------------
2.Known Issues
-----------------

//Skill upgrade widget crash
&gt; Base game localization bug i can&apos;t fix. Set your game to english, upgrade her skills, set langage back to whatever you need.

//Town Event / Trinkets
&gt; No bonus Fawn recruits event, i don&apos;t want to bloat the player&apos;s events. Idle resolve bonus only.
&gt; CC Trinkets here : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128406580

//Guild hall glitch
&gt; If it happens, switch the game to english, upgrade Fawn skills, switch back to your desired language.
This is some weird base game bug i can&apos;t fix myself.

//Boobs
Unacceptable, tell reddit about it
&gt; no nipples here http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1189623979
