1.Description
-----------------

Once a Raider and one of Vvulf&apos;s favorite mistress, The Shrapnel met her end during an excursion against the hamlet&apos;s militia. 
At the time fascinated by the Brigand&apos;s Pounder technological marvel, your Ancestor recovered her, half dead, and used her body as an attempt to fuse man and machine.
She eventually escaped with her life, but years later she&apos;s back for his head.

The Shrapnel is a backline AoE specialist heavily relying on marks. 
Her weapon requires frequent reloads you have to pay for, so be careful with your supplies and don&apos;t burn ammo for nothing.

-----------------
2.Known Issues - FAQ
-----------------

//Ammo Packs / Reloads
&gt; Shrapnel&apos;s Expunge requires you to pop an Ammo Pack in order to become usable.
This solidifies her role as an AoE class with S tier access to marking. If you want single target burst damage on top of this, it will cost you money.

//Vent - Overclocking : AT THE VERY LEAST READ THIS
&gt; Don&apos;t end your turn ~
Use these skills or Shrapnel&apos;s efficiency takes a nose dive.

//No shared camping skills ?
&gt; No, Shrapnel hates everyone.

//5 skills ?
&gt; Once you transform her you can&apos;t turn back until the combat ends.
That comes with UI limitations and more particularly move skill pushing the ability to pass your turn out of the UI.
Haven&apos;t got around to find a trick around this yet, it looks weird but that&apos;s the only real problem.
