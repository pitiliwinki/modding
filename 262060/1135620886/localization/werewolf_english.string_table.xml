A rogue of the wild and an alluring predator, the Werewolf puts her skills to good use for gold and the rush of the hunt. She strikes the front line and taunts her foes, as retaliation is her main strategy. If enemies don't fall by her claws, they'll fall by the intense bleeding of their wounds and if she can't reach that pesky back liner, her intimidating roar can make them panic, forcing them out of formation.]]></entry>
    <entry id="action_verbose_body_blacksmith_werewolf"><![CDATA[Different from her abominable peers, she's embraced her beastly condition and enjoys the growth of her power with each kill. This Werewolf, actually a Beast Shifter, wears a cloak to mask her human identity and a corset that once hid a pair of blades, but now only serves to attract unsuspecting prey.]]></entry>
    <entry id="action_verbose_body_camping_trainer_werewolf"><![CDATA[Some would call her a selfish creature, but the Werewolf is willing to share her tricks and secrets with her allies if it raises the chance of a successful expedition. Previously being both hunter and the hunted, survival is her middle name and so she can save herself from the brink of death if... a companion is wiling to lend a hand.]]></entry>
