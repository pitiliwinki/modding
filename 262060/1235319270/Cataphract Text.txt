The Cataphract is a versatile healer who excels at quickly swapping between the fringes of combat. Capable of dealing respectable damage from the back line and spot healing while on the front, the Cataphract fills a valuable role in any party looking to take advantage of backline damage dealers without sacrificing frontline hardiness.
