[h1]Cannoneer - Class Mod[/h1]
====================================

[i]“An evil this great, required a bigger gun.”[/i]

Long and large, loud and powerful; for a small man, a cannon makes for best tool. The Cannoneer employees such weapon of destruction, unleashing its carnage unto those lesser foes, and blasting the face off any larger abominations.

[b]Role:[/b]

Cannoneer takes the role of a powerful damage dealer. However, while devastating, his attack require a turn and few setups to be effective. But even without the pre-setup, he can still function as a status de-buffer, and with certain builds, can still handle himself up in the front as well.

====================================

[b]Design Note:[/b]

Sadly, Cannoneer took some nerfs.  While still a heavy puncher on par with likes of Leaper, some tweaks were made to make him more balance in game.  But the balance is still in the works, let me know how it do.
(also might put up the stronger version later, since it is still fun to play)


====================================

[b]Skills:[/b]

-Light the Fuse: the key to unlock Cannoneer’s devastatin gpower. Give a strong damage boost.

-Kaboom: Single target shots. Synergy with marked target, as it both increase its accuracy and chance to stunt that target.

-Rocket Jump: Attackand debuff front two enemies. Also jump to front.

-Bombardment: Similar to Kaboom, but attack the back two enemies.

-Shrapnel Blast: Attack all enemies and give it minor bleeds. Greater damage on stunted targets.

-Minefield: A riposte attack. Usable only in front spot. Also give yourself some defenseboost.

-“On My Mark”: Mark a target, as well as increase your own accuracy.


====================================

[b]Playing Tips:[/b]
[spoiler]
Cannoneer can be played almost in two modes. One is regular, where you deal out lowdamage attacks that focus more on debuffs. It help set up for your other hero’s attack and stunt. The other is where you take the turn and play Light the Fuse. This make Cannoneer’s attack very strong, but less accurate.

Know your enemies. If face group of smaller monster that have high dodge, or group of smaller parties that you can finish off in 3 turn or less, don’t bother use Light the Fuse. However, against large meaty tanks or bosses, Light that fuse quick!

Most of Cannoneer’s skill work in synergy with Mark. So it helps to have a marker in your party.

Minefield + Light the Fuse is fun way to play him in thefront.

Cannoneer are design so he can’t move. So it helps to have some skill that give him movement in case he got out of position (Kaboom have move back 1, and Rocket Jump have move forward 2).
