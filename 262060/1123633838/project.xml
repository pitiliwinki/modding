1.Description
-----------------

The Tusk is a semi Feral sociopath who lives for pride and boasting after all that was left to her was the satisfaction procured by vengeance. She didn&apos;t come here for redemption or salvation, she only followed her next big prize&apos;s trail to fill a wall of vanity.

Like the Bounty Hunter, the Tusk is a CC/Offense hybrid with high damage potential but limited mobility, although her kit offers a different specialization.

-----------------
2.Known Issues
-----------------

//FMOD debug error
&gt; Ignore, just loading monster SFX and sometimes it&apos;s not needed 

//Town Event / Trinkets
&gt; No bonus Tusk recruits event, i don&apos;t want to bloat the player&apos;s events. Idle resolve bonus only.
&gt; CC Trinkets here : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1128338441

//Boobs
Don&apos;t bother complaining, i don&apos;t care
&gt; no nipples here http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1189624502
