	The [b]Harlot[/b] is attractive, seductive, cunning, and personable. She trades her skills, body, and companionship for gold and is proud to be an independent contractor. In battle, she can rely on her fan-blades and supports the party with buffs that may change a battle&apos;s dynamic. It&apos;s easy for clients to fall in love with her, but for her it&apos;s strictly business.
	
	Harlot is a party support buffer and average bleeder. She can also mark enemies and can alter battle dynamics, and has a very helpful high stress-relief camping skill. Her on-crit effect increases her bleed amount.
	
	NOTE: This mod includes adult themes and content, but the Harlot class is NOT designed to be crude or vulgar, but winky, fun, and sex positive.
