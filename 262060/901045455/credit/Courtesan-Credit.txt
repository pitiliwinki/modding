====================================

[i]“Over, so soon?”[/i]

She walks the nigh street, like a saint, seeking not for comfort, but to comfort other.  While her motivations, that lust of shimmering gold, are simple, the skills of her trades, are not.

[b]Role:[/b]

Courtesan offers a great support and healing, both for mind and body.  She is also skillful in distracting and de-buffing her enemies. The girl also knows how to take care of her own, packing a pair of hidden blades, ready to steal your heart. 

Courtesan is build for hp and stress healing.  While not the strongest in that area, they usually offers additional buff or twist to those skills.  She is also useful in disrupting enemy positions and apply de-buffs.  While she is not strong in combat, she does have some self-defending abilties.
