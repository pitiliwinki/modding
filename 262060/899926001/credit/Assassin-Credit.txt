[h1]Assasssin - Class Mod[/h1]
====================================

[i]“*whispers* A coin for a death, a fair trade, won't you say? ”[/i]

The lady in red. Soak in blood of her marks, the Assassin are master tradesmen of killing.  And in a town so full of death, business is good. 


[b]Role:[/b]
A mobile front-line fighter that’s trained for critical strikes that rewards for a high-risk, high-reward play style.

A lightly armor front line fighter, specialized in marking target, and taking down marks (in cold blood efficiency).  Her dodge and high crits are her best asset... next to a dagger cross the enemy's throat, that is.

Front Line Damage Dealer, Marked/Bleed Manager, Range Damage Dealer


====================================
