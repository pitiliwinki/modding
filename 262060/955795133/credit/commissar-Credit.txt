[h1]Commissar - Class Mod[/h1]
====================================

[i]“Fight! Fight for the Motherland, fight for the Queen. Fight till you die, and fight some more!”[/i]

Commissar was dishonorably banished from her service.  While the result are undeniable, her unconventional method of “inspiring” her men in battle often led to a high causalities and more than one body with bullet hole behind their head.  Undaunted, she seeks a new battleground where her skill can one again be of the service to her Queen.  


[b]Role:[/b]
Commissar is a high specialized support/buff character.  Her biggest attribute is not only buff the damage and defense of her team, but also move them around to the position desired.  She also comes with some weaker, but helpful hp and stress heal skills.  She also pack with a special skill that immobilized the team, keeping them in position (which is handy if you want a double Final Jester, or like lock Ronin or Assassin in place).


====================================

[b]Design Note:[/b]
Might go back and redo the virture and affliction art... if have the time....
This was inspired after the Ronin, of what if to have a class that modified the bounce aroundness of other classes. 

====================================

[b]Skills:[/b]

-Pistol Shot: Basic range attack.
-"Get Up There!":  Move a ally foward, and boost their attack.
-"Fall Back!": Move a ally back, boost their defense and small stress heal.
-"Stand Your Ground!": Boost team protection, also add Immobilzation*

====================================

[b]Playing Tips:[/b]
[spoiler]
-Differnt skills work well with differnt party mix.
-Try to boost up her speed so she goes ahead of other.
-Don't want to be pull back by the skill like Medic or Fallback?  Use Stand you ground beforehand, and you can buff them up while keep them in the front line.
