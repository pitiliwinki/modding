*[b]Picaroon &amp; Harlot:[/b] released! Can you rescue their Pets?*
*[b]Now Live:[/b] Pets 2: new Pets for more Mod Heroes!*
*[b]Videos above contain battle Spoilers![/b]*
*[b]Languages[/b]: Pets 2: English, Chinese(S), Korean(A), Spanish, German

[h1]Pets in the Hamlet![/h1]
You can now bring a Pet adventuring! Pets help manage the stress of adventuring and give their owners [b]unique skills, abilities or bonuses,[/b] however, Pets need food too! [b]Extra food[/b] is required for hunger checks in hallways and when camping. So manage your supplies well or risk running out of food inside a dungeon! 

[h1]How Do I Find a Pet?[/h1]
You must rescue pets from the Pet Patrol (AKA Animal Control). The Pet Catcher and his Assistant (and their trained animals!) are always looking to capture animals for training and testing. Defeat the Pet Patrol and free a Pet from their sinister clutches. The Pet Patrol can be fought in 9 new quest dungeons, plus there is a low chance to randomly encounter them in the Warrens, Cove, or Weald, in LVL2 Dungeons or higher.

[h1]The First Quest[/h1]
A Town Event triggers after week 5. The Warrens hosts the first Pet dungeon. You may have to kill base game bosses in Warrens before Pet Quest appears. [b]Highly recommended[/b] to bring LVL2 or higher heros with upgraded skills, armor + weapons, on quest.

[h1]How Do Pets Work?[/h1]
Equip Pets like a Trinket. There is a unique Pet for each base class &amp; DLC class &amp; 32 Mod Classes &amp; 2 extra = 52 Pets total. (1 class Bloat soon!)

[h1]Food Requirements[/h1]
Pets come in three sizes (small, medium, and large) and each pet size has different food requirements. 

To help manage the extra food needed, you may also find and equip &quot;Pet Supplies&quot; which will negate the extra food penalty. You need to &quot;match&quot; the right type of food to the pet size to gain the benefit. Pet Supplies are also equipped as a Trinket.

[b]Pet Supplies[/b]
Treats &amp; Tasty Bites =  Small
Nibbles &amp; Kibbles = Medium
Omnivore&apos;s Delight = Large

[h1]Compatibility[/h1] 
The Pets (Trinket + Monster Mod) is compatible with all Class Mods but NOT ALL CLASSES WITH PETS are required. [b]If a class is NOT installed, then that class&apos;s Pet will NEVER appear.[/b] All Pet effects and buffs are included in Mod, so high compatibility!
*1 reported conflict w/Nightmare Mod (try Nightmare on top?)

[h1]Additional Info[/h1] 
52 Pet Trinkets
3 Pet Supplies Trinkets
9 New Dungeons (Warrens, Cove, Weald) w/Caretaker Goals
1 New Original Art Monster, 4 New Skinned Monsters with new skills + sounds
1 New Supply Item
[spoiler]King Crab Meat[/spoiler]
4 New Quirks
[spoiler]Fear of Pet Patrol, Pet Patrol Adversary, Fear of Lochness Monster, Lochness Monster Hunter[/spoiler]

[h1]Tips[/h1] 
*Always BUY ALL FOOD! Pet skills are powerful, but need to balance food penalty! 
*Correctly interact with curios to gain extra food.
*Pet Catcher fights are NOT EASY (hero deaths are possible or can retreat)

DD1 is entering late stages so we&apos;re okay some Pets are over-powered for fun. You still have to earn them first! Balance is tricky. The order of found Pets can alter your playthrough; high replayability!
