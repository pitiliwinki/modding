The Duchess is a self-sufficient damage dealer with strong defensive abilities and deadly alternate form focused around self-healing and amplifying her crit chance.

Please note: in order to get full functionality out of this mod, Crimison Court should be enabled.

======

The Duchess is a powerful monster, exiled from the Crimson Court, who seeks aid from the Hamlet to usurp the Court's nobility and allow her to take her rightful place as Queen of the Court. To that end, she'll fight alongside your heroes as a brilliant swordswoman, or a ferocious monster. The choice is yours.

===== Trinkets =====

The Duchess' trinkets are all exclusively from the Crimson Court; each of her six trinkets from three different sets mark important parts of the Duchess' past, present, and, possibly, her future.

In order to gain access to these trinkets, the Duchess requires the Crimson Court DLC. The class may potentially function without it, but we provide no guarantees to its stability. Back up your saves before you try breaking anything.
