	<entry id="journal_page_text_72"><![CDATA[(A tearstained journal written over fifty years ago.) They tortured me for stealing the jade ring. I kept telling them that I found it in the laundry, but they ignored me. Then... "I gave her that ring. I saw her practicing sewing all night long, I thought highly of her striving and I gifted it." Your Majesty. Why did you do this for a lowly maid?]]></entry>
	
	<entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[(A journal written long ago, with a bloody handprint on the page.) The army of Qing attacked and took us prisoner. I heard that her Majesty had already passed through the fields of Manchuria. Fearful, sad, furious... I abandoned the palace duty and my friends. I will never be able to go back to my country.]]></entry>
	
	<entry id="journal_page_text_74"><![CDATA[(A journal written long ago, with fragments of faded colored thread on the paper.) A shameless man sneered at me and said ‘How can a girl learn to fight with a sword?’ I never answer to a sod who looks down on another person. Must do anything to survive. Being able to sew is not enough. Truly, I have to do anything...]]></entry>
	
	<entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[(A journal written long ago, the letters scratched deep with emotion.) An old memory suddenly crossed my mind. Why did my mother give me a knife to protect my chastity? If I stab myself, he would try another woman, But if I stab him, he would never do it again. Maybe if the men hear this, they will call me a wicked bitch.]]></entry>
	
	<entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(A journal written on faded colored paper. A butcher bird is drawn at the corner.) This land is not Qing, and not Joseon. It’s a hell where people die of the big disease. I survive in fear. I saw a butcher bird fly away with a dead rat on its back. A wise, tough old butcher bird. Next to the Phoenix, I like it best.]]></entry>
	
	<entry id="journal_page_text_77"><![CDATA[(A journal written on fine paper.) I came back. Ruined, worn out by time. But it feels as if it were yesterday that the evil thing happened here. It should be known why he did such an evil thing. I once tried to ignore the bad sense of attraction, but I could not do it any longer. I MUST GO BACK.]]></entry>

	<entry id="journal_page_text_73"><![CDATA[(A journal written long ago, with a bloody handprint on the page.) The army of Qing attacked and took us prisoner. I heard that her Majesty had already passed through the fields of Manchuria. Fearful, sad, furious... I abandoned the palace duty and my friends.

	<entry id="journal_page_text_75"><![CDATA[(A journal written long ago, the letters scratched deep with emotion.) An old memory suddenly crossed my mind. Why did my mother give me a knife to protect my chastity? If I stab myself, he would try another woman, But if I stab him, he would never do it again. Maybe if the men hear this, they will call me a wicked bitch.]]></entry>
	
	<entry id="journal_page_text_76"><![CDATA[(A journal written on faded colored paper. A butcher bird is drawn at the corner.) Europe is not Qing, and not Joseon. It’s a hell where people die of the big disease. I survive in fear. I saw a butcher bird fly away with a dead rat on its back. A wise, tough old butcher bird. Next to the Phoenix, I like it best.]]></entry>
