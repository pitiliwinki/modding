Butcher bird - Class Mod

---


Butcher bird is refugees from so far small east country.

Running away from the Manchuria cross the Silk road, She had to do anything to survive. Not surprisingly, passed time has fragile palace maid was change into a veteran escort. She survived barely else for a living learned sewing and cleaning skill from royal palace. But she's truly survive skill is an open-heart sociability and a strong determination.


She can bleed enemies when she in the middle line and can used debuff skill while on the front. If will take risks from come out the back line, she pierced deadly into heart of the prey. When Butcher bird promises 'devetion' a party member, essentially turns her into a "dodge tank". evade attacks and riposte a enemy who dared to harm ally.
