[h1]Ironclad - Class Mod[/h1]
====================================
** With Animation by Muscarine**

[i]“Forged in iron and fire, a new weapon against the darkness.”[/i]
From a recovered blue print found in the Ancestor’s estate.   Retooled and forged by the ingenious mechanics at Monsieur Musc’s workshop.   With boilers burning and gears clinking, this walking war machine is ready to face that evil that is to come.   

[b]Role:[/b]
Just like what it look like, Ironclad is both a heavy tank and a hard puncher.  Suited as frontline, it has high natural protection and good self-healing, make it helpful to soak up damages.  It also can hit very hard (stronger than Leper), granted its range is somewhat limited.  It does have a few downsides, such as its habit of gear jamming or overheating itself (self stun), so still need to play with caution.  

====================================

[b]Design Note:[/b]
I like Mech. 
Sadly, facing some FMOD audio issue, so couldn't put in some custom sound.  Will use some standard filler for now.  

====================================

[b]Skills:[/b]

-Iron Fist: Basic melee attack.
-Drill Punch: Strong penetrating attack. 
-Oil Spill: Debuff enemy group, and set up for Flamer .
-Flamer:  Good AoE attack. 
-Spike Rain: Backrow range attack.
-Grease Gear: Self buff and small heal.
-Self Repair: Self Heal and Buff, but stun Self.

====================================

[b]Playing Tips:[/b]
[spoiler]
-It could party well with a antiquarian (to guard) or Arblest (for destun).
-Use Self Repair Just before get out of the battle, so long lasting pleasure... I mean heal.
